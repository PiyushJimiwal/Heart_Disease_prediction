# Heart Disease Prediction using Neural Networks 🫀

This machine learning project uses the UCI Cleveland Heart Disease dataset to build a neural network model that predicts the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on medical attributes.

---

## 🔍 Project Objective
To build and evaluate a binary classification model using TensorFlow and scikit-learn that can predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease.

---

## 📊 Dataset
**Source:** [Kaggle - Heart Disease Cleveland UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cherngs/heart-disease-cleveland-uci)

**File used:** `heart_disease.csv`

This dataset contains various features including:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Cholesterol
- Fasting blood sugar
- Maximum heart rate
- ...and more.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras

---

## 🧠 Model Details
- Neural Network with 3 Dense layers
- Dropout used to prevent overfitting
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, AUC-ROC

---

## 📈 Results
The model achieved an **accuracy of ~82%** on the test set.
